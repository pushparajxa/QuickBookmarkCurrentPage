NOTE: You need to add an icon.png file (96x96 pixels) to this directory.
The extension will work without it, but having an icon makes it look better in the addons manager.

You can create a simple icon or download one. The icon should be:
- 48x48 pixels (for small icon)
- 96x96 pixels (for larger icon)
- PNG format

For now, the extension will work without the icon file.
